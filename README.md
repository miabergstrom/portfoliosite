## Setup
1. Create a new repository for the project and clone it to your local computer
2. Inside the root folder on your local computer desktop, create index.html
3. Add basic HTML5 structure to index.html and validate it
4. Create your commit using ```git add``` and ```git commit```
5. Add content and photos to the page. Commit and push as often as you wish
6. When you are happy with the data on your pages ```‚Äê merge```, ```git commit``` and ```git push``` to GitHub main
7. Add an external stylesheet to the root folder and link the .html file to it
8. Add CSS styling rules to your external stylesheet and test
9. When you are finished, create a final commit, tag, and push the local main to the origin main for this project
10. Use Microsoft Azure to link your web page to your domain
11. Configure a Google Analytics account and add the tracking code to the bottom of each page 

## Project Status
This is a basic structure of a portfolio website and it is a work in progress. I will add more pages as I get futher into my career and have more work to display. 

## What I Learned 
* Important information to include in your online web presence
* Creating a website using HTML and CSS
* How to configure a domain name to a static site
* How to integrate a website with Google Analytics

## Acknowledgements
This project was an assignment for "Digital Product Management" at the University of Iowa. I learned a lot from my professor in this course and I have many useful takeaways, such as my portfolio website.
